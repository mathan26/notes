# Recursion
* Calling the same function again and again is called recursion.
* Need to give some exit condition.
* Break it down into smaller problems.
* Divide the problem into sub problems.
* Recurrence relation when you can write that into formula.

## examples
* Fibonacci numbers , i.e sub problems leads to ans
  * Find the base condition. F(0) = 0 , F(1) = 1
  * Formula  F(n) = F(n - 1) + F (n - 2)
  * Figure out it recursive tree.
  * last function call tailored recursion
