<h2>React Full Stack Application</h2>
<hr></hr>

#WebHook
<hr></hr>

```One Server makes request to another server at any time because of some evenet```
https://sendgrid.com/blog/whats-webhook/

#Localtunnel (just for reference)
<hr></hr>

```Localtunnel allows you to easily share a web service on your local development machine without messing with DNS and firewall settings``` 
  
 ```  Localtunnel will assign you a unique publicly accessible url that will proxy all requests to your locally running webserver```
https://localtunnel.github.io/www/

#Ngrok setup instead of LocalTunnel
<hr></hr>

```npx ngrok http 5000```

<p>After running the above command Forward URL will be generated by ngork.
This is valid only for 8 hours.
Once Server stopped ,need to generate again.

# React

1 What is React? What is it purpose?

```React is a JavaScript library used to show the HTML content to the user and handle the User Interaction.```
```But it can also work with tremendous libraries, packages and servers to make React even more poerful```

2 How to make React Components?

```React Components Made using either JavaScript functions or classes``` 

3 What was the HTML or JSX looking stuff?

``` It's look like html and placed between the JS.It is converted to HTML code when rendering the Components``` 

4 How to handle the User Interaction with the components?

```Event handlers are used to detect the User Interaction and respond to it.``` 

5 What is React and React-DOM in the import section do?

```React knows what components is and how to make component work together```
```ReactDOM knows how to take components and make it show up in the DOM.```

6 How to create React Project?

```npx create-react-app app-name```
```It provides default setup WebPack, Babel, Dev Server.No need to Setup manually.```

# Data Structures and Algorithms

 1 Introduction
 * Variables 
 * Data Types
 
    ![Data Types In Java(/Images/17 Data Types In Java.PNG)
    
 * Data Structures 
 
   *Once we have data that is stored in the variable we need some mechanism to manipulate the data,*
  
   > Data Structure is a way of storing and organizing data in a computer, so that it can be used efficiently.
   
   Depending on the organization of elements ,DS classified into two types:     
   1 Linear Data Structures
    > Elements are accessed in a sequential order.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
   2 Non Linear Data Structures
   > Elements of this DS stored/accessed in a non-linear order. 
   
* Abstract Data Type
    > To Simplify the process of solving problems ,we combine the data structures with their operations
    > and are called ADT.
   * Two Parts:    
        * Declaration of Data 
        * Declaration of Operations
* Algorithm
    > An Algorithm is step-by-step instructions to solve a given problem.   
* Analysis of Algorithm
    > It helps us to find which of them is efficient in terms of time and space consumed.
* Goal of Analysis of Algorithm
    >Compare the Algorithms of different solutions.
* Running Time Analysis
    > It is the process of determining how process time increase as the size of the problem.
* Compare Algorithms
    > Running time of given algorithm as a function of input size n.
* Rate of Growth
    > The rate at which running time increase as a function of input is called rate of growth.
    We can igore the small terms when compare with big terms.

* Commonly used Rate of Growths
    
   Time Complexity | Name | Example 
   ------------ | ------------- | -------------
   1 | Constant | Adding Element in the front of the list
   logn | Logarithmic | Finding an element in sorted array
   n | Linear | Finding an element in unsorted array
   nlogn | Linear Logarithmic | sorting n items by 'divide-and-conquer' Mergesort
   n^2 | Quadratic | Shortest path between two nodes in a graph.
   n^3 | cubic | Matrix Multiplication
   2^n | Exponential | The Towers of Hanoi problem
   
  * Comparison from low to high processing,
    > 1 < log log n < âˆšlogn < log^2 n < 2^logn < n < log(n!) < n log n < n^2 < 2^n < 4^ < n! <2^2n
      
      
      
* Types of Analysis
    * To analysis the algorithm we need to know what input algorithm takes less time and on what inputs
    it takes huge time.
    * Three types
        * Worst Case (Big O)
            * Defines the input for which algorithm takes huge time.
            * Input is the one for which the algorithm runs slower
        * Best case (Big Omega)
            * Defines the input for which algorithm takes less time
         * Average Case (Theta)
            * Provides prediction about the running time of algorithm
            * input is random.
* Asymptotic Notation
    > Expression for Best ,Worst and Average
* Big-O Notation
    > Find tight upper bound of the given function.The function , f(n) = O(g(n)) iff +ve Constants C and n0
    > such that 
                   
                  f(n) <= C*g(n) for All n>= n0
    
    Example:
        f(n) = 2n + 3
        <br/>
        2n + 3 <= 10n n>=1
    Here C = 10, g(n) = n
    <code> 2n + 3 < = 2n + 3n=5n</code>
          Therefore 
    ```f(n)=O(n)```
    
    * In big-O write closest function i.e near of growth rate of f(n)
