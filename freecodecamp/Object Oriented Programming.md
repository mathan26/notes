## Create a Basic JavaScript Object

 - Think about things people see every day, like cars, shops, and birds.
   These are all objects: tangible things people can observe and
   interact with.
 - What are some qualities of these objects? A car has wheels. Shops
   sell items. Birds have wings.
  
 - These qualities, or properties, define what makes up an object.
Create a dog object with name and numLegs properties, and set them to a string and a number, respectively.
